# On-board_Computer_Software
Part of my engineering project - inspection vehicle on-board computer software.

### Needed stuff:
- Raspberry Pi (I used RPi 4b)
- camera (I used the RPi Camera v2)
- LED ring (I used a ring with 12 RGB WS2812 5050 LEDs)
- dc engines controller (I used a two-channel motor driver - Pololu TB6612FNG)
- dc engines(I used N20 motors which are similar to the popular Pololu DC motors) 
- three push buttons (two are enough for the main tasks)<br /> <br />

### ! The program must be run as root. Command to run: sudo python3 <program_name.py>. This is required by the neopixel library that supports the LED ring !
